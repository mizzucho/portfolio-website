            <p>I conducted a S.W.O.T analysis on the health monitoring app Carrot Care and Sansara. It was important for me to investigate what existing applications are already offering to the audience. Both of the applications crucially lacked
              tutorials and guidance for the new users. This is critical because people who take the blood tests most often are the older adults who are not as comfortable with technology.</p>

              motivation to learn how to use the application. I decided to make an accountability feature and shifted my target audience to the younger generation, the people in their 30s and 40s, for now in the hopes that they would motivate their
              older family members to stay healthy together.</p>
            <p><span>Survey:</span> I took surveys to study more about people’s perception of taking blood tests. The most interesting finding was that even though young people often don’t care about the blood tests, they are very interested in
              trying out a new health monitoring application. I also learned that people are more worried about registering credit card information than registering medical information.</p>

            <p>This was the most difficult and exciting part of the entire design process for me because I got to push my creative ability to visualize the life of the users that don’t exist in real life. Laying out several personas with different

              design process helped me imagine what kind of relationship I want users to have with Snapshot and visualize the lifestyle of the people using Snapshot in their daily life.</p>

              chose. I realized that I might be still making a few wrong assumptions about the audience. For instance, participants expected to find the guidance and health advice on the search page, but I was not planning on including the guidance
              and health advice on the search page originally. This insinuates people might navigate to the search page for different resources, so I decided to create different categories on the search page to guide users to the right resource.</p>

            <p>Before creating the meats of the design, I wanted to create firm bones that would serve as a good foundation for further design decisions. I made sure that the I.A. contained the solutions for the three villains I address above
              (difficult access, difficult terminology, and unorganized data). I created a library page for easy access, a search bar to look up medical terminology, and an analytics page that would organize the entire blood results in a graph.</p>
            <p>Simultaneously, I was worried that different features of Snapshot (profile, setting, lab locator, and reminder) would just leave users confused and steal the attention away from the main features (library and analytic) so I wanted to
              focus on creating a healthy design hierarchy that would draw users’ attention to Library and Analytics pages before the other sub-feature pages.</p>

            <p>Time to bring all the ideas to real life! Hand drawing all the wireframes on the paper was really helpful to me. Creating digital wireframes online is efficient and time-saving. However, users interact with the mobile application on
              their own device physically. Thus, physically drawing out the wireframes helped me visualize how people would be interacting with each design component more realistically. Personally, traditional hand drawing practice helps me stay
              creative and dump out all my ideas straight from my head. However, hand-drawing prevents from making design iteration because it takes a long time. I would only be focusing on how I want to layout each design component for each page. I
              had to constantly tell myself not to spend too much time on the interface details.</p>

            <p>Time to add some meats to the bones. Using an online prototyping tool, Figma, I digitally transferred my low fidelity wireframes to the computer where I added colors and appropriate design components that would display a healthy design
              hierarchy. Throughout the entire process of creating high-fidelity wireframes, I engraved in my head to always question myself- am I creating a good memorability? good learnability? good accessibility? easy navigation? good color
              contrast? Easy navigation was the most difficult to evaluate because I’m biased towards my own design. Observing different case studies done by other designers and studying how other created minds connected different frames were the
              most helpful practice in jumping over this hurdle as a designer who’s learning how to prototype for the first time. You can view the polished UI at the bottom of this portfolio.</p>

          <div class="container-text">
            <p>One of the issues identified from the usability tests was the dull color system of the wireframes. I initially wanted to adapt a black-and-white color system to make the application look organized and formal. However, I personally
              agreed with the participants at the same time. I conducted an A/B preference test and found out that the majority preferred the colorful signup page, so I decided to adapt a more colorful color system across my design.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <div class="container-text">
          <p><span>Working Alone:</span> There were many times I was stuck between more than two ideas. During those times I wished I had teammates to ask for the objective perspective on the situation so I could move on. I learned that I tend to
            spend a long time making design decisions because I’m biased towards my own design. When I think back, I would have appreciated working with other designers because it would have given me another level of motivation.</p>
          <p><span>Too much Freedom:</span> Because I got to spend as much as I want on my project, I wasted too much time chasing the idea of the “perfect solution”. Since this is the first UX project I’ve worked on, I tried to build a firm
            foundation one by one rather than trying to finish the project as fast as possible. However, after spending a long time on one project, I’ve learned that achieving small goals on a planned schedule is more important and efficient than
            making compromises to be perfect because there is no “perfect design”.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <div class="container-text">
          <p><span>You have to be a good person to be a good UX designer:</span> The reason why I wanted to continue to grow as a UX/UI designer is that my journey as a UX design not only taught me how to make eye-catching designs but also challenged
            me to become an empathetic person. It forced me to really put myself in other people's shoes to understand their real pain points. The rewarding satisfaction coming from solving a problem that a lot of people might be experiencing around
            the world hits different.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div >
        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <div class="container-text">
          <p><span>Communicating skills:</span> I want to become a designer who not only designs well for the customers but also designs well with teammates. I think the strongest skill one designer could have is communicating skills with the
            teammate to bring the maximum potential to the team as a whole. Thus, my goal is to work with different individuals with different backgrounds who will challenge me to become better at understanding the customers with different
            backgrounds.</p>
          <p><span>Technical skills:</span> As of now, I will continue to learn to master the software skills (Figma, Aftereffect, 3d illustration-blender, etc) and, at the same time, I want to be involved in teams that would challenge and guide me
            so that I could build a firm foundation and grow mentally flexible and strong.</p>
          <p><span>Big dream as a UX/UI designer:</span> As a person who has work experience in healthcare and a deep interest in AR/VR, I’m deeply interested in healthcare UX/UI and AR/VR UX/UI. Hopefully, there will be a new field where healthcare
            and VR are integrated so that I could learn both.</p>
